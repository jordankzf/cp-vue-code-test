# cp-vue-code-test

## Notes

I added a loading state as well as a loading animation.
However, since the API used is pretty quick, you can't really see the transition between states.
Try using _Developer Tools_. Under the _Network_ tab, set _Throttling_ to _Slow 3G_.

## Commands

Same old, same old. As usual, `yarn install` then `yarn serve`.
